            <div style="padding-top: 5%"><h1>Nikhil Chinapa</h1></div>
          
           <div style="padding-top: 4.5%">  
            <p>To say that Nikhil Chinapa has donned many an avatar during his career, is like saying it snows 
                in Alaska; a bit of an understatement. He morphs from DJ to VJ to MC to Music Promoter to Festival 
                Director —some of his best known avatars — with amazing fluidity.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="padding-top: 4.5%"> 
            <p>He studied Architecture and graduated with a Thesis in Hospital Design. A year later and for
                reasons that scientists are still trying to understand, Nikhil joined MTV. He said, “I think
                it’ll be fun.” For once, he was right.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="padding-top: 4.5%"> 
            <p>At MTV, Nikhil has hosted almost every show the channel has aired. From MTV Select – MTV’s longest 
                running show, (it aired continuously for 10 years) to being the host of Splitsvilla, a judge on 
                Roadies as well as Rock On and now host of MTV Mashups.
            </p>   
            </div>

            <div> 
            <p style="padding-top: 4.5%">Nikhil’s Mom still thinks he’s an idiot though and should get a real job.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div style="padding-top: 4.5%"> 
            <p>As a popular VJ, Nikhil got to spend a lot of time around his first love, music. In 2001, a 
                conversation between friends resulted in the launch of Submerge — India’s first, and now largest 
                Indian Electronic Dance Music (EDM) company in India.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div style="padding-top: 4.5%"> 
            <p>By now, Nikhil had begun to DJ professionally and plays, well… whatever he feels like. His sets 
                are moody, varied, often erratic but usually fun. Most of his sets feature frantic foot-stomping 
                and the random flailing of arms – sometimes by him. They also feature music – the kind that has a
                 repetitive monotonous beat and is best enjoyed at dangerous decibel levels.
            </p>    
            </div>
            <div style="padding-top:4.5%" > 
            <p>Nikhil was also the co-founder of Sunburn. He is now the Festival Curator and partner of Vh1 
                Supersonic, Goa’s brand new beach music festival.
